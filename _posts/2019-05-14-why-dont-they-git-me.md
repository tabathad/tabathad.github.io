The last few days of work have focused on deploying the most excellent changes made by the support team for our help docs at work. It has been fantastic minus the frustration of getting my permissions set to do so and the deep desire to make git my bff even though I sit a different table in the cafeteria and I don't wear the right shoes. 

Here are my most used commands lately <code> git status</code>, followed by <code>rm -r entire-repo</code>, peppered with <code>reset --hard HEAD{n}</code> and "eff it" <code>push -f this-will-totally-work</code>
